The Boston Housing dataset contains data collected by the US Census Service concerning housing around Boston Massachusetts. It was obtained from the StatLib archive (http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/datasets/boston). The dataset has 167 cases. The data was originally published by Harrison Jr, David, and Daniel L. Rubinfeld. "Hedonic housing prices and the demand for clean air." Journal of environmental economics and management 5.1 (1978): 81-102. The BostonHousing.xlsx dataset has 11 attributes. The dataset comes with different imperfections (missing and outliers). As described earlier, most algorithms will not process records with these imperfections.

## Data Handling and Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains techniques, data, and examples related to handling missing data and outlier detection in a dataset. The provided tasks are aimed at understanding and addressing missing values, outliers, and implementing data handling techniques using Python.

## Content
- **Part A: Review of Techniques and Data**
  - This section provides an overview and references regarding techniques for handling missing data, outlier detection, and examples.
  
- **Part B: Handling Missing Data and Outlier Detection**
  1. **Missing Data Handling**
     - Identify and handle missing values excluding the PTRATIO predictor. Cells with missing data are highlighted in yellow.
  2. **Outlier Detection in PTRATIO Predictor**
     - Identify potential outliers in the PTRATIO predictor and classify the potential causes: typing error, data entry error, or genuine outlier. Outlier cells are highlighted with their respective causes labeled as a, b, or c.

- **Part C: Data Manipulation**
  1. **Substituting Missing Data with NaN**
     - Replace missing data with NaN (not a number).
  2. **Python Code Implementation**
     - Provide Python code for:
       - Omission: excluding missing values from analysis.
       - Imputation: filling missing values using techniques like mean, median, or machine learning-based methods.
