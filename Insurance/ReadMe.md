# Health Insurance Price Prediction and Regression Analysis
(https://github.com/AdityaDabrase/DSPortfolioProjects/blob/main/DS-ML/Insurance/%20Insurance.ipynb)


Many factors influence health insurance premiums, and understanding these variables is crucial for predicting costs accurately. This project explores the relationships between age, gender, BMI, number of children, smoking habits, and region with health insurance charges.
## Overview

### Linear Regression
Linear Regression is a simple and interpretable model suitable for linear relationships between features and the target. Fast training and prediction make it advantageous, but caution is needed with high-dimensional data to avoid overfitting.

### Ridge Regression
Ridge Regression handles multicollinearity effectively and includes regularization to prevent overfitting. It is a good choice when dealing with multicollinearity, requiring tuning for the introduced hyperparameter.

### Lasso Regression
Lasso Regression performs feature selection by setting some coefficients to zero. It is beneficial when feature selection is crucial or when working with high-dimensional data, though it may be sensitive to outliers.

### Random Forest Regressor
Random Forest Regressor excels in handling non-linearity and complex relationships. Robust to outliers and reducing overfitting through ensemble techniques, it is suitable for datasets with intricate patterns, albeit less interpretable and potentially computationally expensive.

### Polynomial Regression
Polynomial Regression captures non-linear relationships and can model complex patterns. It is useful when a simple linear model is insufficient. However, it's prone to overfitting, especially with high-degree polynomials.

## Conclusion

The analysis concludes by comparing the performance of the regression models. Linear regression, Ridge regression, Lasso regression, Random Forest Regressor, and Polynomial regression are evaluated based on their pros and cons.

Linear regression is simple and interpretable, suitable for linear relationships. Ridge regression handles multicollinearity effectively. Lasso regression performs feature selection. Random Forest Regressor is robust for non-linear relationships, while Polynomial regression captures complex patterns.

To visually compare the models, a bar plot of feature importances for the Random Forest Regressor is included.

This comprehensive analysis provides insights into the factors influencing health insurance charges and guides the selection of an appropriate regression model for prediction.
